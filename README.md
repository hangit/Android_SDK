Looking to integrate with the HangIt Android SDK? Everything you need is here.

Check List
-------
Here's a check list of everything you need to get started.

 1. Register your app on the [HangIt Campaign Portal](http://portal.hangit.com). 
 2. Read the [Android Integration Guide](https://github.com/hangit/Android_SDK_2/blob/master/Android_Integration_Guide.md) for instructions and sample code. 
 3. If you'd prefer to use our Developer API instead of the Portal, check the API docs here. 
 4. Please let us know if you find a bug, or have a question or feature request. Email us at support@hangit.com.
